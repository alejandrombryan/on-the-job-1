        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>What's so great about a mathematician from the Middle Ages? Fibonacci
            created the coolest sequence of numbers in
            history, where each one equals the sum of the two numbers before it
            (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 - you get it). A thousand
            years since his death, people have noticed this sequence in nature,
            applied it in business and architecture, and
            created music inspired by its pattern. We think that's pretty cool!
        </p>

        <p>For the last 3 years, Fibonacci's has served a sequence of good food to
            anyone who enjoys a nerdy pun. Now we are expanding to bring you a food truck!
            Enjoy Fibonacci's at local events or book us for a neighborhood visit or
            special occasion.
        </p>

        <p>Fibonacci's is owned by Paula Delfino and inspired by her father Raul, a
            retired teacher who taught with great knowledge in the classroom and a wacky
            sense of humor everywhere else.
